# AI Gaming Agent üéÆ

The project aims to apply a comprehensive AI gaming agent framework built on top of **smolagents** to create intelligent agents capable of playing and mastering various types of games, from simple board games to complex universal gaming environments.

## Technology Stack

- [SmolAgents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents): A lightweight framework for building AI agents.
- [Cradle](https://github.com/BAAI-Agents/Cradle): A framework which attempts at General Computer Control (GCC).

## Architecture

The architecture is reference from [Cradle](https://github.com/BAAI-Agents/Cradle).

## Environment Installation

It is suggested to use a remote virtual environment for environment configurations to prevent from directly executing the Python code generated by the AI agent locally. For details please take reference to [SmolAgent Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/index).

1. Please install a virtual environment.

   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv # Name it as .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate # Activate .venv
   ```

2. Install necessary libraries.
   ```
   pip install smolagent
   ‚Äúsmolagent[toolkit]‚Äù # For basic tasks
   ‚Äúsmolagents[openai]‚Äù # For OpenAI API
   "smolagents[vision]" # For computer vision tasks
   "smolagents[docker]" # To execute code in a sandbox environment for security
   "smolagents[telemetry]" # Add support for monitoring and tracing
   ```
