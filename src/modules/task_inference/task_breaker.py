Task: {task_goal}

Current Screen State:

Requirements:
- Each subtask should be concrete and achievable
- Subtasks should be ordered logically
- Keep subtasks high-level (don't specify exact clicks)
- Focus on ACTIONS, not observations (avoid "review", "check", "verify", "observe")
- Each subtask should change the system state or interact with UI
- Final subtask should be the completion of the goal, not a verification step
- Aim for 3-6 subtasks

GOOD examples:
- "Click the Start button to launch the game"
- "Navigate to settings menu"
- "Enter username in login field"
- "Submit the search query"

BAD examples (too vague):
- "Review the search results" (what does review mean?)
- "Check if game loaded" (no action specified)
- "Verify the page" (passive observation)
